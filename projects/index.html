				<p>	
				As project manager, I led and managed a group of 2 other students by directing tasks, organizing workflow, and hosting scrum meetings; I also 
				managed Git submissions, project deadlines, and was also responsible for bug testing and maintaining project quality control.
				In terms of programming, I created the entirety of environmental design and level layout/progression, in addition to many
				various C# scripts for core gameplay mechanics and player-environment interaction. Furthemore, I designed and coded all of the UI
				(main menu, tutorial, pause, game over/win scenes and respective scripts).</p>

			<h2>Stereo Camera Calibration for YOLO NN Depth Detection/Object Recognition    -(Python, OpenCV, Linux/Windows)</h2>
			<p>I took a heavily distorted fish-eye stereo camera and calibrated it with Python OPENCV to return live and static rectified images and videos by calculating
			each camera's fundamental matrix and epipolar line. After this, I generated live and static depth maps that determined an object's relative distance
			from the stereo camera system as well as fellow objects around it, for both live video and static images. This in combination with YOLO V4's Object Detection 
			Neural Network allowed me to simultaneously determine an object's identity, as well as its distance from the camera system,  all in real time (with the option of static images too!).</p>
