			<p>I calibrated a Fisheye Stereo Camera setup using Python OPENCV to return live rectified video, pictures, and depth maps for depth detection. 
				This was done in conjunction with YOLO V4's Object Detection capability to simultaneously determine the identity of an object and it's 
				relative distance from the camera system, all in real time.</p>
