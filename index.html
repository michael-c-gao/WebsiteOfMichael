	<h1>About Me;</h1>
	<p>Hi there! My name is Michael Gao, and I am currently a third-year Computer & Information Sciences major at the University of Oregon.
	I have a strong background in Python, C, C#, and C++, as well as experience in a variety of Operating Systems, such as Windows, Mac, and Linux/Unix.
	My interests lie in the intersection and interaction between digital software and physical hardware, such as using Camera Systems for Object Detection,
	and by extension, the Oculus Rift. Besides this, I am heavily interested in game development. I was the project leader for my web-slinging action platformer, Web of Unity, and currently am working on a
	unique true 3D fighting game, SpaceFight. I am actively looking for Summer/Fall 2021 internships, as well as job oppurtunities after graduation in the summer of 2022. </p>
